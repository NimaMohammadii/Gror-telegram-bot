# Awesome Store Website

This folder contains a simple static e-commerce website. It is meant as a starting point and includes a few example products with basic cart functionality implemented in JavaScript.

## How to use

Open `index.html` in your browser. Click on **Add to Cart** for any product and then toggle the cart view using the **Cart** button in the header.

No backend is included; this is purely client-side and intended for demonstration purposes.
